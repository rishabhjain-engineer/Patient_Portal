    <b>1. What is Zureka?</b>

    <br>Zureka is a new service that helps you discover labs around you and get discounts of up to
    50% on routine to special tests.

    <br><br>
    <b>2. What can I get discounts on?</b>

    <br>You can get discounts on almost any path and radiology tests from blood sugar to cultures to
    profiles to X-Ray and MRI scans.

    <br><br>
    <b>3. I am unable to find a test. What to do now?</b>

    <br>Some tests have multiple names or spellings. While we try our best to make sure to account

    for all that, there are chances that we may have missed something. Feel free to call or email at

    <font color="#1998ca"> support@zureka.in</font> or fill up the feedback form and we will be glad
    to assist you in the

    process.

    <br><br>


    <b>4. Isn&#39;t there an easier way then typing all these tests?</b>

    <br>Sure there is! Feel free to call us on the numbers listed on our site. You could also
    WhatsApp us

    your prescription or even upload it from one of the many conveniently located links on Zureka.

    You could of course simply email us at <font color="#1998ca"> support@zureka.in</font>

    with your contact details and we will

    get back to you with the best options.

    <br><br>
    <b>5. I want to continue living a healthy life and wish to avail a health package. What to
        do?</b>

    <br>That&rsquo;s brilliant! Pick up your phone or just write to us at <font color="#1998ca">
    support@zureka.in</font> and we will

    make sure that you get the best packages possible based on your needs.

    <br><br>
    <b>6. What&rsquo;s this coupon all about?</b>

    <br>For tests like X-Ray or MRIs etc. you would have to physically visit the lab to get your
    scans

    done. In order to make sure you still get that discount we generate a coupon for you, which

    you can then show to your lab upon arrival.

    Alternately, if you are just in the mood for a walk or a quick drive and wish to visit the lab
    on

    your own then go ahead and use that coupon. It would also work.

    <br><br>
    <b>7. How do I get in touch with the lab?</b>

    <br>Simply use the get details button to get their contact and address details sent to your
    phone

    via SMS and/or email.

    <br><br>
    <b>8. I am unable to find any labs in my region?</b>

    <br>We are adding labs on a daily basis but there are still regions we haven&#39;t touched yet.
    Please

    let us know at <font color="#1998ca"> support@zureka.in</font> and we will help to find the best
    alternate for you.

    <br><br>
    <b>9. Do I need to make any preparations for the test?</b>

    <br>Different tests have different requirements; some tests require fasting while some don&#39;t.
    We

    would request you to coordinate with the experts (your lab) on this, as they would be well

    versed on the same.

    <br><br>
    <b>10. When is the sample collection person going to come to my home?</b>

    <br>We have worked with all our partnered labs to coordinate with you first. A lab
    representative

    will give you a call and setup a time and place as per your convenience. However if its urgent

    and the lab is taking some time to make the first contact then please give us a call and we will

    make sure that the collection is done on an urgent basis.

    <br><br>
